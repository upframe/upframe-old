I have been thinking a lot about the meaning of this word lately. Wikipedia defines an entrepreneur as a _person who starts, organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable initiative and risk_. English dictionaries define it as the _activity of setting up a business or taking on financial risks in the hope of profit_.

With the ever growing and widespread use of the word, these definitions can become a hazard because the word 'entrepreneurship' is often associated with glamour and success and by encapsulating both the good traits of entrepreneurship and the bad ones, often undermined, they lead aspiring entrepreneurs on a bitter road paved with anxiety and frustration: Taking on financial risks in the hope of profit don't necessarily make you a successful, good entrepreneur. In fact, they may as well make you a bad one (yes, bad entrepreneurs are real).

**Rather than taking on financial risks blindly in the pursuit of profit the entrepreneur understands that, in order to be successful in his endeavour, he needs to promote the elevation of either collective or individual happiness.** The creation of pain relievers and pleasure gainers  (which can be translated into  the so called value proposition). By focusing on giving and comprehending people, the entrepreneur will understand the pain experienced by a set of customers and eventually build something they are passionate enough about to buy — the beacon of product market fit, which may in turn lead to profit.

At Upframe we’re not concerned with the current meaning of 'entrepreneurship' or 'entrepreneur'. We care instead about the meaning they could have in the future. -- The meaning that could be imprinted. This is important because understanding how we look at it will help you realize there’s something far greater lying beneath the mission we set for ourselves of guiding first-time entrepreneurs through a mentorship-driven process to get their idea to an early stage of development.
